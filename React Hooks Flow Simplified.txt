# React Hooks Flow

## Simplified

**Title**: Understanding React Hooks Flow

**Main Points**:
1. **Mounting Phase**: What happens first
2. **Update Phase**: How changes are handled
3. **Unmounting Phase**: Cleaning up
4. Importance: Using React components and hooks effectively

**Description/Examples**:
- **Mounting**: Initially, steps like using `useState`, rendering components, updating the DOM, and running `useEffect` happen in a set order.
- **Updating**: When state or props change, React re-renders, updates the DOM, cleans up old effects, and runs new effects related to the current render.
- **Unmounting**: This phase mainly focuses on executing cleanup functions, such as those in useEffect, to handle tasks like clearing timeoutId, removing DOM node references, and detaching event listeners when components are removed.
- **Importance**: Understanding these phases well, demonstrated with `app` and `child` components in examples, is key for managing component behavior and using hooks like `useEffect` correctly.

**Conclusion**:
Understanding the flow of hooks during Reactâ€™s lifecycle phases (Mounting, Updating, and Unmounting) is key for handling effects and making sure your application runs smoothly. Knowing these phases and their order helps developers manage rendering, state, and side effects in components effectively.

**My Thoughts**:
Understanding how React works inside improves debugging and helps build efficient components. Trying out and observing different lifecycle phases strengthens knowledge and is useful for developers at all levels to see theory in action.
