# React Hooks Flow

## Simplified

**Title**: Understanding React Hooks Flow

**Main Points**:
1. **Mounting Phase**: Getting started and showing the component
2. **Update Phase**: Handling changes
3. **Unmounting Phase**: Doing cleanup
4. Importance: Using hooks and components effectively

**Description/Examples**:
- **Mounting**: React does several steps at the start: it sets up state with `useState`, renders components, updates the DOM, and runs `useEffect`.
- **Updating**: When state or props change, React re-renders, updates the DOM, takes care of old effects, and runs new `useEffect` calls.
- **Unmounting**: When a component goes away, cleanup functions (like those in `useEffect`) are run to avoid problems like memory leaks.
- **Importance**: Understanding these steps helps manage how components behave and use hooks properly and efficiently.

**Conclusion**:
Understanding how hooks flow through Reactâ€™s lifecycle phases (Mounting, Updating, and Unmounting) helps manage effects and ensures your application runs well.

**My Thoughts**:
Understanding how React works inside helps in debugging and making optimized components. Practicing and noting down these phases enhances this knowledge, which is helpful for developers at all levels.
