# The FLow of Hooks in React

## Formal

**Title/Topic**: Understanding the Flow of Hooks in React

**Main Points**:

1. **Mounting Phase** in React and the sequence of operations it performs
2. **Update Phase** and its procedure to manage changes and effects
3. **Unmounting Phase** and its role in cleanups
4. The importance of understanding these phases for effectively working with React components and hooks

**Detailed Description/Examples**:

- **Regarding the first main point**: During the mounting phase, certain steps happen in order: executing lazy initializers (like `useState`), rendering the component, updating the DOM, running layout effects, painting the screen, and executing effects (via `useEffect`).
- **Regarding the second main point**: The update phase includes rendering due to state or prop changes, updating the DOM, executing cleanup for effects from previous renders, running layout effects, painting the screen, and executing effects related to the current render.
- **Regarding the third main point**: The unmounting phase mainly deals with running cleanup functions for effects as the component is removed.
- **Regarding the fourth main point**: A deep understanding of these phases, shown with `app` and `child` components in the example, is very important for efficiently handling component behavior, especially when using hooks like `useEffect` with different dependencies and cleanup functions.

**Conclusion/Summary**: The flow of hooks during the lifecycle phases (Mounting, Updating, and Unmounting) of React components decides how effects are managed and executed. This mechanism is vital for ensuring optimal performance and behavior in a React application. Fully understanding these phases and their order assists developers in managing rendering, state, and side effects well across components.

**My Thoughts/Ideas**: Understanding the under-the-hood workings of React can significantly enhance the debugging process and helps creating more performance-optimized components. Trying out and logging different lifecycle phases solidifies knowledge and is an excellent practice for both beginner and experienced developers to see theory in action.

**Title/Topic**: Getting the Hang of How Hooks Work in React

**Main Points**:

1. What happens in the **Mounting Phase** of React
2. What the **Update Phase** does to manage changes and effects
3. The role of the **Unmounting Phase** in doing cleanups
4. Why knowing about these phases inside out is key when working with React components and hooks

**Detailed Description/Examples**:

- **About the first point**: So in the mounting phase, a bunch of stuff happens in a set order: lazy initializers get going (like with **`useState`**), the component gets rendered, the DOM gets updated, layout effects run, the screen gets painted, and effects get executed (with **`useEffect`**).
- **About the second point**: The update phase is all about rendering when state or prop changes, updating the DOM, cleaning up effects from previous renders, running layout effects, painting the screen, and getting effects related to the current render going.
- **About the third point**: Mainly, the unmounting phase is where cleanup functions for effects get run as the component gets removed.
- **About the fourth point**: Really getting these phases, shown with **`app`** and **`child`** components as an example, is pretty crucial for handling component behavior smoothly, especially when using hooks like **`useEffect`** with various dependencies and cleanup functions.

**Conclusion/Summary**: How hooks flow through the lifecycle phases (Mounting, Updating, and Unmounting) of React components is what decides how effects are managed and run. This mechanism is key for making sure performance and behavior are spot on in a React app. Really getting these phases and the order they happen in helps developers manage rendering, state, and side effects smoothly across components.

**My Thoughts/Ideas**: Getting how React works behind the scenes can really boost the debugging process and help create components that are more performance-tuned. Trying out and logging different lifecycle phases just solidifies knowledge and is a top-notch practice for both newbies and seasoned developers to see theory in action.
