**Title:** Lifting and Co-locating State in React

**Main Points:**
1. Implementing Lifting State in React
2. Using Co-locating State in components
3. Adjusting to changing requirements through refactoring

**Details:**
- **Point 1:**
    - Lifting State is used when several child components need the same state. For example, the states of "name" and "favorite animal" are lifted to the common “App” component because the “display” component needs them.
- **Point 2:**
    - Co-locating State means moving state to where it’s used. The "name" state is moved from the “App” component to the “name” component since it’s only used there.
- **Point 3:**
    - Changing requirements, like Peter (Product Manager)'s need for only “animal” in the “display” component, means state management and component rendering must be adapted.

**Conclusion:**
"Lifting State Up" and "State Colocation" in React allow flexible state management in component design. The former allows shared state among child components by moving it to a common parent, while the latter places state in the component using it, simplifying the API and potentially optimizing performance.

**My Opinion:**
- This useful tutorial explains and shows "Lifting State" and "State Colocation" in practice, providing React developers with valuable insights and solutions.
- Requirement changes in project development are common, and managing state management flexibly and accurately to adapt to these changes is essential. The tutorial provides a practical baseline method and reference for future changes.
