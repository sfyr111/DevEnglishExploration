**Title/Theme:** Lifting and Co-locating State in React

**Key Points:**
1. The implementation and importance of Lifting State in React components
2. The application of Co-locating State within components
3. Code refactoring and state management adjustment with changing requirements

**Detailed Description/Examples:**
- **Regarding the first key point:**
- "Lifting State" becomes a strategy when multiple child components need to access and modify the same state. In the example, the states of "name" and "favorite animal" were originally managed in their respective components, but because the “display” component needs to access these states, they were lifted to the nearest common parent component — the “App” component.
- **Regarding the second key point:**
- "Co-locating State" involves moving state to the component where it is directly used. In this case, the "name" state was initially in the “App” component, but since it was only used and modified by the “name” component, its state was moved to the “name” component, simplifying the API of other components and improving performance.
- **Regarding the third key point:**
- Peter (Product Manager)'s change in requirements triggered a change in state management strategy. Initially, the “display” component needed “name” and “animal”, but later only needed “animal”, changing the management of states and the rendering of components. Adapting to these changes and making appropriate code adjustments and refactorings is necessary.

**Conclusion/Summary:**
In the design of React components and state management strategies, "Lifting State Up" and "State Colocation" demonstrate the flexibility and diversity of state management. "Lifting State" focuses on how to allow multiple child components to share and interact with a state by moving it to the nearest common parent component, ensuring data consistency and coherent interaction. "State Colocation" focuses on placing the state inside the component that uses it, not only simplifying the component API and reducing unnecessary prop passing but also bringing potential performance optimizations — such as avoiding unnecessary re-renders of parent components and concentrating updates on components associated with a specific state. Strategy selection and adjustments should be made according to the demands of the components and the usage of the state, ensuring our application manages state in a more reasonable and efficient way.

**My Views/Thoughts:**
- I think this is a very practical tutorial. It not only explains the concepts of "Lifting State" and "State Colocation" but also demonstrates how to implement these concepts in code through specific examples. This provides clear direction and problem-solving strategies for React developers facing similar issues.
- In real project development, requirement changes are common, and how to deal with state management flexibly and accurately to respond to these changes is something every developer needs to consider. This tutorial effectively shows how to do these things in practical applications and provides a baseline method and reference for possible requirement changes in the future.


## Concise

**Title:** Lifting and Co-locating State in React

**Main Points:**
1. Implementing Lifting State in React
2. Using Co-locating State in components
3. Adjusting to changing requirements through refactoring

**Details:**
- **Point 1:**
    - Lifting State is used when several child components need the same state. For example, the states of "name" and "favorite animal" are lifted to the common “App” component because the “display” component needs them.
- **Point 2:**
    - Co-locating State means moving state to where it’s used. The "name" state is moved from the “App” component to the “name” component since it’s only used there.
- **Point 3:**
    - Changing requirements, like Peter (Product Manager)'s need for only “animal” in the “display” component, means state management and component rendering must be adapted.

**Conclusion:**
"Lifting State Up" and "State Colocation" in React allow flexible state management in component design. The former allows shared state among child components by moving it to a common parent, while the latter places state in the component using it, simplifying the API and potentially optimizing performance.

**My Opinion:**
- This useful tutorial explains and shows "Lifting State" and "State Colocation" in practice, providing React developers with valuable insights and solutions.
- Requirement changes in project development are common, and managing state management flexibly and accurately to adapt to these changes is essential. The tutorial provides a practical baseline method and reference for future changes.
